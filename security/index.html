    <header>Security Assessment of a Ride Hailing Service</header>
    <p id = "name">Written by Devki Kalra</p>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p> The purpose of this lab is to identify and examine potential flaws and vulnerabilities
            with the web application hosted at https://jordan-marsh.herokuapp.com/. This application 
            was created by Ming Chow for the security lab of the COMP120 course. The app's function is to 
            allow users to enter their username, longitude, and latitude. A number of security flaws found in the 
            source code make this application unstable and unusable for public use. 
        </p>
    <h2>Methodoly</h2>
        <p> I used curl on my local device. I tested the service by changing the parameters 
            and checking the output on https://jordan-marsh.herokuapp.com/. I likewise used Burp 
            to find additional vulnerabilities and/or gain a deeper understanding 
            of the vulnerabilities I had already identified.
        </p>
    <h2>Abstract of Findings</h2>
        <p>The biggest issues found in this security assessment concerned XSS and SQL injections. Each of the 
            issues detected were high in severity and thus expose the massive vulnerabilities in this application. 
            User input wasn't effectively sanitized allowing scripts to be stored and executed from the server, and poor 
            restrictions around database access meant the contents of the database could be easily manipulated. 
        </p>
        
    <h2>Issues Found</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>XSS Injection</li>
                <ul>Issue: Injection into username parameter</ul>
                <ul>Location: https://jordan-marsh.herokuapp.com/</ul>
                <ul>Severity: <font color="red">HIGH</font></ul>
                <ul>Description: The username parameter can take in any input. There is no such restriction or validator for 
                    the username (like there is for the lat and lon values, as these must be floats). As a result, JavaScript 
                    code could be passed in as the username parameter. This type of injection is referred to as an XSS injection.
                </ul>
                <ul>Resolution: This issue can be resolved by sanitizing the input. This could be 
                    done through setting a limit on the number of characters that can be entered in the 
                    username parameter. </ul>
            <li>SQL Injection</li>
                <ul>Issue: Injection into database</ul>
                <ul>Location: https://jordan-marsh.herokuapp.com/</ul>
                <ul>Severity: <font color="red">HIGH</font></ul>
                <ul>Description: This issue was detected on Burp and arises when user-controllable data is incorporated 
                    into database SQL queries. With this web application, users can easily manipulate the database with 
                    a curl request. I should note that I didn't test this issue myself (in part because I wasn't sure how to)â€”the 
                    SQL injection vulnerability was outlined in Burp. Nonetheless, I decided to include it in my report 
                    because I understand the vulnerability.
                </ul>
                <ul>
                    Resolution: According to the issue remediation outlined in Burp, the most effective way to prevent SQL 
                    injection is to use 'parametized queries' for all database access. Meaning, the application should specify 
                    both the structure of the query and contents of the variable. In this way, it is impossible for malformed data to 
                    be injected into the database. 
                </ul>
        </ol>
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
