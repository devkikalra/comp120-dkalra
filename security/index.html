    <header>Security Assessment of a Ride Hailing Service</header>
    <p id = "name">Written by Devki Kalra</p>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p> The purpose of this lab is to identify and examine potential flaws and vulnerabilities
            with the web application hosted at https://jordan-marsh.herokuapp.com/. This application 
            was created by Ming Chow for the security lab of the COMP120 course. The app's function is to 
            allow users to enter their username, longitude, and latitude. A number of vulnerabilities 
            were identified in this web application, making it unsafe and thus unusable for public use. 
        </p>
    <h2>Methodoly</h2>
        <p> I used curl on my local device. I tested the service by changing the parameters 
            and checking the output on https://jordan-marsh.herokuapp.com/. I likewise used Burp 
            to find additional vulnerabilities and/or gain a deeper understanding 
            of the vulnerabilities I had already identified.
        </p>
    <h2>Abstract of Findings</h2>
        <p>The biggest issues found in this security assessment concerned XSS and SQL injections. Each of the 
            issues detected were high in severity and thus expose the major security flaws with this application. User 
            input wasn't effectively sanitized and there were poor/no restrictions around database access—both of which 
            left significant opportunities for breaches in security. 
        </p>
        
    <h2>Issues Found</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>XSS Injection</li>
                <ul>Issue: Injection into username parameter</ul>
                <ul>Location: https://jordan-marsh.herokuapp.com/</ul>
                <ul>Severity: <font color="red">HIGH</font></ul>
                <ul>Description: The username parameter accepts any form of input. There is no such restriction or validator for 
                    the username (like there is for the lat and lon values, for example). As a result, JavaScript 
                    code could be passed in as the username parameter. This type of injection is referred to as an XSS injection, 
                    wherein an attacker tricks a web application into sending data in a form that a user's browser can execute. 
                </ul>
                <ul>Resolution: This issue can be resolved by sanitizing the input. One of the ways in which this could be 
                    done is by setting a limit on the number of characters that can be entered in the 
                    username parameter. </ul>
            <li>SQL Injection: malformed data</li>
                <ul>Issue: Injection into database</ul>
                <ul>Location: https://jordan-marsh.herokuapp.com/</ul>
                <ul>Severity: <font color="red">HIGH</font></ul>
                <ul>Description: This issue was detected on Burp and arises when user-controllable data is incorporated 
                    into database SQL queries. With this web application, users can easily manipulate the database with 
                    a curl request. Meaning, a user could insert pretty much any value into the database. I should note that I didn't 
                    test this issue myself (in part because I wasn't sure how to)—the SQL injection vulnerability was outlined 
                    in Burp. Nonetheless, I decided to include it in my report because I do understand the vulnerability.
                </ul>
                <ul>
                    Resolution: According to the issue remediation outlined in Burp, the most effective way to prevent SQL 
                    injection is to use 'parametized queries' for all database access. Meaning, the application should specify 
                    both the structure of the query and contents of the variable. In this way, it is impossible for malformed data to 
                    be injected into the database. 
                </ul>
            <li>SQL Injection: number of insertions into database</li>
                <ul>Issue: Users can make any number of insertions into the database. </ul>
                <ul>Location: https://jordan-marsh.herokuapp.com/</ul>
                <ul>Severity: <font color="red">HIGH</font></ul>
                <ul>Description: This issue, again, was outlined in Burp and wasn't tested directly by me. The issue 
                    here is that the user can make an infinite number of insertions into the database, which could potentially
                    crash the application. 
                </ul>
                <ul>Resolution: To resolve this issue, one could limit the number of entries into the database from a given IP address.</ul>
        </ol>
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>As can be seen, there are several major issues with this web application—all of which can be resolved by the 
            solutions proposed above. This was a really interesting assignment as I would have never considered any of these issues—both
            in the scope of this lab and in my daily life—if it weren't for this week's security module. The content covered in this 
            assignment has drawn my attention to just how easy it can be to identify vulnerabilities in code, hack websites, and perform
            malicious data breaches. Hopefully, after this assignment, I will actually listen when a website tells me my password isn't "strong" enough. </p>
